      <p>Hi my name is <b>Djalma Da silva.I'm a Brazilian </b> and I'm learning web development. I created the portfolio just to show my ability 
        and to check later here how i was when i started to code. I know that there are  a lot of professionals out there but everyone has a chance and I'm
         here to take it, It's a lot of work but it's very pleasurable.
      </p><br />
      <p>I love to do web development like many others. I started fixing computers, and then I fell  fell in love with programming and code 
         and started trying to learn something by <b>Youtube , Google, Solelearn </b>. I'm very busy at my work but you know
         , who has a
            cell phone has a computer. Most of the time i start something on my phone and then i sync it to my computer when i get home, i also have with 
          me one laptop all the time in my backpack for the lunch time. If i have the chance and time i will </p> <br />
      <p>With love and dedication I have been learning day by day.</p>
