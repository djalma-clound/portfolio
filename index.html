        <p>
          I'm a web developer with a passion for creating beautiful and
          functional websites. I've always been fascinated by the power of the
          internet to connect people from all over the world, and I believe that
          well-designed websites can help facilitate that connection in
          meaningful ways. Whether it's a simple blog or a complex e-commerce
          platform, I take pride in creating websites that not only look great,
          but also work seamlessly for both the user and the client.
          <br /><br />
          In addition to my technical skills, I am also committed to staying
          up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in web
          development. I am constantly learning and experimenting with new
          technologies and techniques, and I believe that this willingness to
          adapt and evolve is key to creating websites that are both relevant
          and effective.
          <!-- <br><br>
        When I'm not coding, you can usually find me exploring the great outdoors or spending time with my family and
        friends. I believe that a healthy work-life balance is essential to both personal and professional success, and
        I strive to maintain that balance in everything that I do.
        <br><br>
        Overall, I am passionate about web development and dedicated to creating websites that not only meet, but exceed
        my clients' expectations. If you're looking for a skilled and enthusiastic web developer, I would love to hear
        from you!-->

        HTML <br />
        <p class="p">
          HTML is the foundation of every website, and it works by using tags to
          define the structure and content of a web page. These tags are
          enclosed in angle brackets, and they can have attributes that provide
          additional information about the element.

      </div>
      <div>
        CSS <br />
        <p class="p1">
          CSS allows developers to define the style, layout, and appearance of
          HTML elements such as text, images, and other content. With CSS,
          developers can control the font size, font color, background color,
          and layout of these elements, and can also add animations,
          transitions, and other visual effects.

        JAVASCRIPT <br />
        <p class="p2">
          JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is
          commonly used in web development. It is a versatile language that can
          be used for a wide range of applications, including building
          interactive web applications, developing mobile apps, creating games,
          and more.

        PHP <br />
        <p class="p3">
          PHP code is typically embedded in HTML files and executed on the
          server-side. It is often used to generate dynamic content, such as
          database-driven web pages, and to create web applications that
          interact with databases.One of the key features of PHP is its ability
          to work with a variety of databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and
          Oracle.
